        <span> Hello! Iâ€™m Billy, a Software Engineer from Nairobi.</span>
        <br />
        <br /> Since 2020 I chose to pivot into the tech industry as a
        self-taught engineer, with a strong focus on front-end development and
        some experience in back-end development having the desire to go
        Full-Stack in the near future.
        <br /> <br /> I educated myself through great online resources such as
        FreeCodeCamp courses and continuously learned from excellent YouTube
        developer channels. With about 1 year of experience in the industry, I
        spent a significant amount of time honing my skills building personal
        projects, and filling any knowledge gaps through continuous learning
        practices.
        <br />
        <br /> I also have an ardent interest in web3 development and artificial
        intelligence which is an area I see myself venturing into as it drives
        me to improve my skills and expand my knowledge.
        <br />
        <br /> Overall, I am determined to constantly elevate my understanding
        as an engineer and individual in order to impact my environment and
        society as a whole, providing solutions to complex problems and
        essentially having fun along the way.
